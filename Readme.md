# Marc Concepcion's Demo on using PHP's Win32 Service library.

We can run any PHP scripts as Windows Service 
which can be a good way to run daemons on Windows Operating System machines.

When you open the Task Manager or Services in your Windows OS, 
you can see and control the PHP script as a Windows Service there.

I tried running this demo PHP project as a Windows Service and it works well so far.
The caveat so far is that we have to log-in as Administrator on our Windows OS to successfully run this service.

Thank you.
